# This notebook takes a Gaia-style catalogue and performs clustering in integral of motion space according to LÃ¶vdal et al. (2021).
# Requires some libraries, most notably vaex, numpy and matplotlib. After changing the variable "catalogue_path" to indicate where your star catalogue is stored, you should be able to run the cells in order, and obtain a catalogue containing labels for significant clusters in integral of motion space.
#
#
# The input catalogue should contain heliocentric xyz coordinates and xyz velocity components, where necessary quality cuts has been readily imposed. The input should contain halo stars and a little bit more, as we use vtoomre>180 when scrambling velocity components to obtain an artificial reference representation of a halo.

# # Linkage Clustering
#
# ### SOFIE
# Perform clustering on the original data.
# This should not take too long, around 2-3 minutes with an input size of 5e10^4.
# Z is the linkage matrix outputted by the single linkage algorithm, where each row i indicates one step of the algorithm:
# At the i-th iteration, clusters with indices Z[i, 0] and Z[i, 1] are combined to form cluster (N+i),
# where N is the number of original data points. Z[i, 3] indicates the number of members in the group formed at step i.

# 15s on 5e5 Gaia sample
